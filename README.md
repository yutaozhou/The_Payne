# The Payne
Tools for interpolating spectral models with neural networks.
It is just for personal test, please refer to the original source: https://github.com/tingyuansen/The_Payne

## Installation
Clone this repository and run code from the base directory.
```
python setup.py install

pip install -U git+git://github.com/yutaozhou/The_Payne

````

The [tutorial](https://github.com/tingyuansen/The_Payne/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb) shows some simple use cases.

## Dependencies
* The spectral model and fitting routines require only Numpy and Scipy.
* Training a new neural network requires [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) (GPUs required).
* All these dependencies will be automatically installed alongside with this package
* I develop this package in Python 3.7 using Anaconda.

## Citing this code
* Please cite [Ting et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...879...69T/abstract), when using this code. The paper describes the method and its application to APOGEE spectra.
